# Meeptey2's Boxel 3D Mod
A modded version of [Boxel 3D by Kargoh](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/boxel-3d/mjjgmlmpeaikcaajghilhnioimmaibon)
I made this in like a day after I learned that .crx files were just renamed .zip/rar/7z files.

## Modding Guide
Currently, the mod is in a early state. So no modding guide yet, but I'm working on it.
